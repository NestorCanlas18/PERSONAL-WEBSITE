                    <h1>GHOST OF TSUSHIMA</h1>
                    <p>Ghost of Tsushima follows the story of Jin Sakai, a samurai warrior on the Japanese island of Tsushima during the Mongol invasion in the late 13th century. After his lord is killed and his home is overrun, Jin must adapt to new, unconventional tactics to protect his people, forsaking traditional samurai codes in favor of stealth and guerrilla warfare.
                     As he becomes the "Ghost," Jin struggles with the conflict between his samurai honor and the need to fight in a way that goes against everything he was taught. The game explores themes of honor, sacrifice, and the cost of war as Jin faces tough moral choices in his quest to reclaim Tsushima and defeat the Mongol forces.
